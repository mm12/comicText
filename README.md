# comicText
A project that translates comic panels, with the artist's and community's help. 
# How it works:
Artists can upload their work to their favorite art website, with no text versions. The community can just input similar manually. 
The website asks for various placement, style, etc. information about the text, where the artist (or others) can put the transcription of their comic. Translators can then translate the comic's textboxes directly, rather than needing to redraw and edit the image. Should no translation be available, Google translate and DeepL can be used to translate the comic, since the text is, well, text, and not part of the image.
